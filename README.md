# Stable Diffusion dataset tag editor

Made with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/)

Does not support resizing/cropping images (shoutout to [Birme](https://www.birme.net/?target_width=512&target_height=512))

It allows you to tag datasets without any captions in folder (from the scratch).

## How do I use this?

1. Install required pip packages (nicegui and numpy)
2. `python3 main.py`
3. A browser window for localhost:8080 will open.

This version does not currently support multi-user operation, although you can access the page from any device on your network.

## Can I use this code?
